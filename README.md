ðŸ”§ What I Did:

Structured the calculatorâ€™s layout using HTML for a logical and accessible interface.
Styled it with CSS (leveraging Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness) to ensure a polished look.
Powered the logic with JavaScript, tackling challenges like accurate floating-point calculations, handling user inputs, and implementing complex math functions.
Added features like error handling for invalid inputs and a clear button for smooth user experience.

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built It:
This project was a personal challenge to deepen my understanding of front-end development, especially DOM manipulation and event handling. I learned a ton about managing state, debugging precision issues in JavaScript, and optimizing for performance. It was both fun and rewarding to see a blank page transform into a functional tool!
